## 🛠️ Built With
- **Python** — Core programming language
- **tkinter** — Standard GUI library
- **customtkinter** — For a modern UI look
- **pygame** — For audio playback
- **pypresence** – to connect with Discord Rich Presence

## 📝 Notes

- Once a song finishes playing, the system automatically selects and plays another track at random, effectively operating in a default shuffle mode.

## 📂 Why I Built This
This project started as a personal exploration of Python's GUI and multimedia capabilities.
I wanted a simple and functional app to play Mayday Parade songs (since I'm a huge fan of the band), much like an offline Spotify or Apple Music while practicing Python in a creative way.
It's also part of a broader goal to explore more projects outside my main academic and professional focus.
