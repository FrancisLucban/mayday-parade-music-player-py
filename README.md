## 📂 Why I Built This
This project started as a personal exploration of Python's GUI and multimedia capabilities.
I wanted a simple and functional app to play Mayday Parade songs (since I'm a huge fan of the band) while practicing Python in a creative way.
It's also part of a broader goal to explore more projects outside my main academic and professional focus.
